## Q&A

Q: How do I - personal or non-profit - cite the contents here?

A: Well ... No need to ask, just use it. Attribution is cool, but I won't cry if you forget lol.

This isn't about credit — it's about fulfilling my curiousity...

---

Q: How do we - government or small orgs - cite the contents here?

A: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, simple!

---

Q: Why do you allow goverment or small orgs to use the content here?

A: Actually, I must confess - if I'm doing a good enough job (I'll try my best), the docs here could be used for either mental wellness or mental manipulation. However, like I mentioned, it's about fulfilling my curiousity, and this curiousity covers the irl scenarios, conducted by "another party of the social contract", or "Imagined community" ... you name it. I hope them could do that for the good of the people - definitely. However, if not ... it's still a good case study (sigh). I'll just be loyal to my curiousity as always ... and wish the best for human beings. 頑張れ/Ganbare!

Q: Why so strict to commercial entities?

A: Well because the big coporations has well designed procedures and work flows, to transfer any potential changes to status quo - which would make everything boring. While it's less interesting, it gets helpless to my curiousity. However I'm not that stubborn, anyone could buy me with one of the following things:

* A detailed design blueprint of the "Oracle Machine" cast by Alan Turing. (You just need to come over the halting problem's paradox!)
* The correct proof of P v. NP problem
* A set of equipments which allows the civilizatios at similar levels as Planet Solar III, to observe a black hole in a closed distance (closer than Roche limit), w/ doing corresponding experiments. (String theory supporters, sorry or your welcome...? jkjk)

Q: What if people misuse your theory for real-world psywar?

A: "bro I wrote 1984 didn't mean you to take it as a manual" - George Orwell (No he didn't say it). Well, something above coveres this questions.

---


Q: Are you really putting this on your almost real-name public repo?

A: tbh, that might even make me safer. Dead man’s switch is already on anyways ... (don't worry it's more for accidents lolll)

---

Q: What if some orgs threaten you?

A: (yawning) not horrible enough ... next. (Wait, maybe it means I'm doing a really good work ...)

---

Q: Aren't you afraid "those people" will stalk you?

A: omg thanks for the protection!! Could you also guard my laptop while I’m in the bathroom ... when I'm in a cafe or library ...? I appreciate that ...

---

Q: isn’t this dangerous?

A: so is living. At least I pick my flavor. (you don't want to know how many times I'm 1 inch away from dying lol)

---

Q: what do you expect from posting this?

A: joy, clarity, and... maybe a few sleepless nights for the people who are trying to destroy human beings' mental wellnesses. Nothing major.

---

Q: Are you fighting against any authorities or governments?

A: (sigh...) Well... I think I made it quite clear in the disclaimer already.

There are better things to be curious about, trust me.

---

### Q: okay let's be serious, what's exactly your thinking about these contents?
A: lol... okay, let's say if the contents are really THAT impacting. Actually, we all know human beings are stepping into a new age, which is triggering an evolution of brain, cognition, intelligence, psychology, and etc. However, numerous trauma patterns in our brains are barring us from that step.

To me, human beings are a very interesting species — the pure existence of humans is already the result of a series of events with a probability of 1 in 10^2,685,000. And such miracles happen every day.

So, tbh, I'm quite optimistic about the result of this civilization-level challenge. I'm also very interested in the ways human beings are passing through it, with the mentality of an observer. That, to me, will be a shining part in all of my pre-and-post-life journeys.

But again — as I said above — the pure motivation is still the joy and curiosity of exploring how something complicated works. So I don’t really care that much about what the contents might cause... but if it helps anyone even a little bit with their own mental wellness, it’s also a kind of “Eureka (εὕρηκα)!” moment for me.
