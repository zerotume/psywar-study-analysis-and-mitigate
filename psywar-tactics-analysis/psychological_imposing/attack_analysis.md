# "Psychological Imposing"

## ideas for now:
- intentionally blurring the differences between 2 terms (e.g. "the mother v. the nation", "the father v. the leader) etc.
- humans in that "group" would cast emotion transference towards to an objective term
- deficiency & deprivation of such connections is a big factor (or even a key approach)
- perspectives to build the deprivation / dificiency: language manupulation, stigmanization / labeling ... (add more!)
- to mitigate, distinguish the term and their emotions (how ...)
