# Important Humans' Names

## Paul Linebarger (aka Cordwainer Smith)
### his dad was a close personal adviser to Sun Yat-Sen (cough)
#### Sun (almost) became his godfather????
### "Psychological Warfare"
### Many readers really believed he's covert agent from the future; expresses a good skill for a propagandist
### childhood sharp political eye - he figured out the "impressive ceremony" when Calvin Coolidge took oath
### important view: "psychological warfare is good for everybody"
### "the affirmation of human community against the national divisions" - propanganda is "affirmation of human community"
### book "Scanners Live in Vain" - about tough process of gov reform
> - "a psyop should be like the cranching wire" sounds like my view of "using cognitive biases to fight against cognitive biases" -> it's actually enlightening a human being's safe sense of "unknown" so that the "curiousity/exploring part" is triggered instead of the "flight/avoiding part"
### "The Dead Lady of Clown own" & "The Ballad of Lost C'mell"
- political uprising by psyops
### "Telepathy" -> popular metaphor during when ppl thinks govs / super powers controlling ppls minds
### psywar tool access - small & portable devices + long time support (radios in WW2, smart phones today, etc.)
| WW2 Nazi | Today You-know-whos |
| Falsified Stations | fake official accounts |
| defeatist messages | hoax / misleading |
| ghost programs when official off-air | bot accounts in void of official medias | 
| "New British Broadcasting Company" aka fake BBC | "Post" aka fake "Times" |
| microcelebrities aka influencers | microcelebrities aka influences (yeah same) |
| chaotic, ever-changing set of commentatiors | "flood the zone" |
