# Low Literacy Trigger Decelerator
## Executive Summary

A helper system for the nature that more than 50% people in the US has lower than 6th grade reading capability, with the psywar armed in their minds. This system focuses on interferring the "trigger source -> emotion -> triggered reactions" flow, by delaying the process of each part, so that giving the time and chance for their logical functionalities to take effect.

## Methology In Detail

| Area                        | What’s good                                                                                                  | Potential gaps & concrete add-ons                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trigger detection**       | • Three-emoji “Hook” taxonomy is instantly recognisable.<br>• 15-s videos fit the dominant media diet.       | • *Coverage*: anger/fear/conspiracy → fine, but add **“us-vs-them pride”** (a powerful MAGA hook).<br>• *Personal calibration*: allow users to log what *they* notice triggers them (sticker sheet / tap-to-flag). |
| **Delay mechanism**         | • Visual “red-light flash” + 10-s timer keeps literacy load low.<br>• Two-step share plug-in gives friction. | • *Micro-reward*: after the 10 s, flash a “+1 Brain Point” animation—adds dopamine to the *pause*, not the outrage.<br>• *Offline fallback*: printable “stop cards” for people without smart-phones.               |
| **Logic kick-in**           | • Counter-corpus retrieval for those who do read.<br>• “Challenge session” prompt every 40 turns.            | • For 6th-grade readers, swap text explanations with **comic strips / 3-panel memes** (“Fact-dodger vs. Fact-checker”).<br>• Quick audio summaries (≤ 45 s) for non-readers.                                       |
| **Belonging replacement**   | • Vitality circles & paper chat-rooms create no-cost offline glue.                                           | • Add an *identity badge*: e.g., “I’m a 10-Second Pauser” wristband. Shared symbol ⇢ instant tribe without ideology.                                                                                               |
| **Metrics & feedback loop** | —                                                                                                            | • Define one “north-star metric”: *avg. time-to-share* on partner Wi-Fi networks.<br>• Monthly SMS poll (Y/N) → “Did you wait yesterday?” Keep stats simple.                                                       |
| **Sustainability**          | • Volunteer-centric; low cash.                                                                               | • Rotate *micro-grants* (\$200–\$500) for local iterations; winners share templates back to the commons.                                                                                                           |

# “Delay each step so logic can engage"

| Chain link            | 6th-grade KPI                         | Example tactic                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1. *Perceive trigger* | Notice red-light emoji                | Stickers, PA announcements        |
| 2. *Activate delay*   | Wait ≥10 s before share               | Two-step button, “+1 Brain Point” |
| 3. *Pick response*    | Choose: *ignore / fact-check / share* | Audio comic, peer hotline         |


# Quick wins to strengthen the package
1. Pilot one county for 90 days – measure the KPI, iterate emoji taxonomy.

2. Bundle “plug-in + sticker kit + 30-video pack” – one ZIP anyone can localise.

3. Publish open dashboard – simple bar chart of share-delay growth (transparency builds trust).
